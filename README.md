Abstract— Sensor networks face critical cybersecurity challenges due to limited computational resources, making traditional static firewalls and deep learning models impractical. This research presents an adaptive Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) that dynamically switches between shallow and deep AI models based on real-time network load and resource availability. Four AI models were trained on 20- and 40-feature subsets of the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Two runtime strategies—On-Demand Model Loading and Pre-Loaded Model Switching—were developed and evaluated. Experiments measured accuracy, inference latency, memory usage, and switching overhead under simulated real-time conditions. The pre-loaded approach achieved 96% accuracy, 98% precision, and 4 ms latency with a 19 MB memory footprint, outperforming static AI firewalls. The proposed NGFW enables scalable, low-latency attack detection in resource-constrained sensor networks without requiring frequent model retraining. Future enhancements include hybrid model architectures, federated learning, and explainable AI integration to further improve adaptability and transparency in edge security deployments.
