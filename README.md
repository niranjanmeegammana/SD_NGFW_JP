Abstract— Sensor networks in smart cities, healthcare, and industrial IoT face growing security threats due to resource constraints in real-time distributed architectures, where traditional security mechanisms struggle against sophisticated cyber-attacks. This study proposes an AI-driven Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) that integrates shallow and deep AI models for anomaly detection in sensor networks. The shallow model, with a single hidden layer of 512 neurons, and the deep model, with seven layers (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4 neurons), were evaluated using balanced 20- and 40-feature UNSW-NB15 datasets. The deep model with 40 features achieved 98.37% accuracy, making it suitable for high-resource sensor nodes, while the shallow model with 20 features provided faster detection with 93% accuracy, ideal for low-resource deployments. The proposed adaptive NGFW dynamically switches between AI models based on sensor network resource levels, ensuring real-time anomaly detection and attack prevention. Future work will explore shallow-deep hybrid architectures for enhanced distributed security in sensor networks.
